- **Ease of Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with databases (e.g., MongoDB) and external APIs (e.g., Google Calendar API).

### Frontend: React.js

- **Dynamic and Responsive UI :** Reactâ€™s component-based architecture allows building dynamic and high-performance user interfaces.
- **Ant Design & Tailwind CSS :** Combined for professional, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing UI components.
- **Reusable Components :** Encourages code reusability and improves maintainability.
- **Rich Tooling:** Extensive library support and tools like React Developer Tools simplify debugging and enhance productivity.

## Features
